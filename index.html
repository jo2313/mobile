				<p><span class="highLi1">Architecture</span> and <span class="highLi1">Music</span> are types of art and permeate deeply into our lives. Music has many different genres and purposes. Among them, <span class="highLi1">film music</span> has a great <span class="highLi1">influence</span> on audiences and directors. It plays an important role in the film industry. In movies, it conveys the plot of the story, such as dialogue or sound effects. It also explains the <span class="highLi1">temporal</span> & <span class="highLi1">spatial</span> background or shows the inner psychology of the character.<br>

				<span class="highLi1">Architecture</span> affects our lives directly and indirectly. Architecture goes beyond the simple function of providing shelter from the rain and cold and plays a very important function that affects the <span class="highLi1">cityscape</span> and even the <span class="highLi1">country's tourism</span> business. Architecture, which affects the interior and exterior of a building and its surroundings, is a very important thing that determines the <span class="highLi1">quality of our lives</span>, and the architect who carries out it is a person who has that much influence on humans and the city and carries great <span class="highLi1">responsibility</span>. Architects are <span class="highLi1">spatial</span> artists who play a very important role in shaping buildings that are the image of a nation and in creating a city.<br>

				It is good to know celebrities and singers who are artists we are familiar with, but I think it is also important to learn about architects and film music composers who are <span class="highLi1">unfamiliar</span> but have a great influence on our lives.</p>
